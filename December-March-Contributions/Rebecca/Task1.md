<summary>Project Description</summary>

Health is the most important and undervalued aspect of human life, and typhoid fever is one of the world's life-threatening infections. According to WHO, 11-20 million people get sick from typhoid each year, and 128 000 to 161 000 people die from it. <!--with at least one episode of culture-confirmed typhoid fever reported in 42 of 57 African countries between 1900 and 2018. The number of typhoid fever reports in Africa has increased over time and has been diverse between countries, with outbreaks reported in 15 countries and their intensity increasing over time [1].-->

Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi, a bacteria that finds it way into the intestine and bloodstream. It enters the body through the mouth and spends one to three weeks in the intestine. After this, it passes through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream, where it spreads to other tissues and organs. Typhoid could be contracted through direct contact with an infected person's feces. Untreated, one in every four cases of typhoid results in death. If treatment is administered, less than 4 out of every 100 cases are fatal [1]. There are several factors that increase the risk of being infected by the Salmonella bacteria. These include visiting areas where typhoid fever is endemic, handling the microorganism, coming into contact with people infected with typhoid fever, having a weakened immune system, and drinking contaminated water.[2] Additionally, Typhoid fever symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, anorexia, headache, skin rashes, weightlessness, stomach distension, malaise, occult blood in the stool, haemorrhages, derilium, abdominal rigidity and epistaxis (bloody nose)[3].

The presence of S.typhi in blood, urine, stool or bone marrow can be used to diagnose the fever. However, due to self-medication, poor diagnosis, a lack of medical experts, and inadequate health institutions, a large number of deaths are linked with typhoid fever, necessitating the advancement and improvement of an accurate typhoid diagnosis system that is accessible to everyone. [3]. Typhoid fever is typically diagnosed using widal tests, blood culture, and stool culture. Widal test has been the most widely used due to its low cost, as most typhoid cases are reported in rural areas. However, [4] discovered that Widal test is not reliable for diagnosis of typhoid except with the integration of blood culture, for a higher accuracy.

These identified flaws which are; the alarming rate of reported typhoid cases and deaths, the inability of typhoid fever patients to communicate precisely how they feel, the inability of doctors and nurses to effectively communicate accurately what they observe, and laboratory results being strewn with errors caused by either carelessness on the part of technicians or instrument malfunction [3] have moved researchers to turn to Machine Learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, to predict the presence of typhoid bacteria in the blood rapidly and accurately.

Machine learning mimics human learning by using data and algorithms. It works by learning from historical or existing data, which serves as input to a chosen algorithm, and by observing patterns and trends in the data, the model makes a prediction. It is currently well suited for analyzing medical data, and it is easier to achieve a goal because there is sufficient data available in the healthcare sector, but the tool required for effective analysis for the discovery of hidden relationships and data trends is lacking [1].

Various existing systems and diagnostic methods have been proposed by various researchers, but they still lack a high detection rate. As a result, this study proposes the use of Augmented Intelligence which combines human decision making and Artificial Intelligence to analyze images and predict the presence of Salmonella Typhi by integrating a machine learning model into the backend of a web application, and the frontend serving as an interface for interactions based on analysis and prediction between medical practisioners and the model for a rapid typhoid fever diagnosis and prediction.

    <summary>Why typhoid is deadly if undiagnosed in time</summary>
    Salmonella typhi, a bacteria, causes typhoid fever. Once inside a host's body, it makes its way to the intestine and bloodstream. It stays in the intestine for 1 to 3 weeks before passing through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream, where it spreads to other tissues and organs. Salmonella infection is usually not life-threatening and can be treated if detected early, but a delay in diagnosis or a misdiagnosis can result in fatal organ failure or death if the fever spreads throughout the body. Serious complications could occur if typhoid is not treated early and  correctly diagnosed especially in infants and young children, older adults, transplant recipients, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems.

Serious Complications that were observed in people with typhoid fever include:
[More details can be found here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7754788/)

Abdominal Problems

Intestinal Perforation/Bleeding [found here](https://thydoc.com/health-blog/typhoid-fever-symptoms-causes-prevention-of-typhoid-fever/): The most lethal complication of typhoid fever is intestinal bleeding. It appears during the third week of illness. A perforation in the intestine occurs when a hole develops in the small or large intestine, allowing intestinal contents to spill into  the abdominal cavity and causing symptoms such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and sepsis. This life-threatening complication requires immediate medical attention. Other possible abdominal complications include:

- Gastrointestinal hemorrhage
- Hepatitis
- Cholecystitis

Cardiovascular Problems

Myocarditis [found here](https://academic.oup.com/omcr/article/2018/12/omy106/5208324): Myocarditis caused by Salmonella is unusual, but it can emerge in regions where typhoid contraction is prevalent. It is the swelling of the myocardium (heart muscles) which can lead to acute heart failure and chronic dilated cardiomyopathy. A person with salmonella myocarditis experienced severe chest pain with radiating sensations. Other cardiovascular issues that could arise include:
- asymptomatic
- electrocardiographic changes
- shock

Neuropsychiatric problems [found here](https://sciworthy.com/how-salmonella-bacteria-get-into-the-brain/): Bacteria, humans, and so on, have the most difficult time entering the brain. Though complications involving the central nervous system are relatively rare, Salmonella can enter the brain and cause significant damage by releasing specific proteins (OmpA and SPI-1) that trick the cells on the blood-brain barrier, allowing the bacteria to bypass the blood-brain barrier and cause a brain malfunction. Over the years, a variety of complications have been reported, including:
- Encephalopathy
- Delirium
- Psychotic states
- Meningitis
- Coordination impairment

Respiratory problems [found here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5094264/): Salmonella may be a pathogenic cause of illness in the lungs, causing respiratory problems. The bacteria could enter the airways, causing Bronchitis, or cause an infection in one or both lungs, resulting in Pneumonia.

Hematologic problems [found here](https://www.pjms.com.pk/issues/aprjun109/article/article1.html): Typhoid fever frequently causes hematological abnormalities. Salmonella infections cause hematological disorders, which mainly affects the blood and blood-forming organs. Typhoid fever is characterized by hematological alteration such as:

- Anemia
- Leucopoenia
- Eosinophilia
- Thrombocytopenia
- Sub clinical disseminated intravascular coagulation.

    <summary>Typhoid: How do I treat it and how often</summary>

[found here](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/typhoid-fever/treatment/) and [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/typhoid-fever/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20378665)

The only effective treatment for typhoid fever is through the use  of antibiotics. Antibiotics work in some stages of the fever, but it may not work in others especially if the bacteria is antibiotic resistant. Antibiotic resistance develops in bacteria when the bacteria has changed over time and antibotics have no effect on the bacteria. To treat typhoid in a body that is already resistant to antibiotics, you may need to purchase more expensive antibiotics or take the ones you already use for a longer period of time but with guidance from a doctor. Drinking water when typhoid symptoms appear is highly recommended because it will help prevent dehydration caused by a prolonged fever and diarrhoea. Antibiotics that are commonly prescribed include:

- Ciprofloxacin (Cipro)
- Azithromycin (Zithromax)
- Ceftriaxone (injectable antibiotic)
- Cephalosporins

Stages of fever and their treatments

The first and second stage

An individual will only experience some of the symptoms of typhoid fever in the first stage, such as a dry cough, or headache. Fever may or may not develop. Even if it does, your temperature will not rise much above normal. The infection at the first stage is usually treatable at home. Progressing to the second stage, the fever is high at this stage, and the stomach becomes distended and there may be signs of weightloss. The individual may experience both fatigued and agitated feelings.  Antibiotics at both stages can be used to treat typhoid at home, but in some cases you may need to be admitted to the hospital.

The third and fourth stage

Complications begin to emerge in the third and fourth stages. There is extremely high fever and might result to abdominal hemorrhage due to severe intestinal perforation. Encephalitis, or brain inflammation, may develop. The person may become dehydrated, which intensifies delirium. The individual will be unable to sit or stand. Hospitalization is usually advised at these stages. In severe cases, an injectable antibiotic may be prescribed and in the case of life-threatening conditions, surgery may be required.

    <summary>World antimicrobial awareness week</summary>
    World anti-microbial awareness week

Anti-microbials are antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, and anti-parasites that form the foundation of medicine. They enable the successful treatment of potentially fatal infections. However, antimicrobial overuse and misuse have emerged as the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites evolve over time and no longer respond to medications, making infections more difficult to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, and death. Antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines become ineffective as a result of drug resistance, and infections become increasingly difficult or impossible to treat. The proper use of antimicrobial drugs aids in the preservation of the efficacy of critical medical treatments.

AAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) has evolved into one of the most serious health threats that humanity faces today. In May 2015, the Sixty-eighth World Health Assembly endorsed a global action plan to address the growing problem of antibiotic and other antimicrobial resistance. One of the plan's main goals is to raise awareness and understanding of AMR through effective communication, education, and training.

World Antimicrobial Awareness Week (WAAW) is an annual global campaign held from November 18 to November 24 to raise awareness of this critical global health issue, aid understanding of AMR and encourage best practices among the general public, health stakeholders, and policymakers, all of whom play an important role in preventing the emergence and spread of AMR. People are needed to raise awareness and prevent resistance by practicing responsible antimicrobial use and following the advice of health care providers.

For more Information about WAAW activities, [check here](https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-antimicrobial-awareness-week/2021/go-blue-campaign)

What leads to Antimicrobial resistance.

- Overuse of antimicrobials
- Misuse of antimicrobials.
- Sharing or using leftover antimicrobial medicines.
- Not taking your prescribed treatment in full, even after youstart feeling better.
- Self-medication without knowing the exact cause of a disease can lead to drug resistance.

How to prevent antimicrobial resistance

- Seek medical advice when you are ill.
- Take antibiotics and other antimicrobials only when prescribed.
- Complete the full treatment regimen as prescribed.
- Get vaccinated.
- Wash your hands regularly.
- Practice safer sex.

Effects of Antimicrobial Resistance

- It leads to a longer treatment time.
- A higher health cost.
- A life long disability.
- Death.

    <summary>Typhoid: How do I know I have typhoid</summary>

Typhoid fever is caused by the bacteria Salmonella Typhi that enters the intestine. It stays in the intestine for one to three weeks, the White blood cells carry the bacteria throughout the bloodstream, it then enters the bloodstream and spreads to other tissues and organs after passing through the intestinal wall. When someone has typhoid fever, you can tell by their symptoms and how they feel,but a test should be performed to be certain. Typhoid is usually not fatal if caught early and treated promptly. When it is not treated promptly, it becomes a problem.

Typhoid fever is common in areas with limited access to clean and purified water and its mode of transmission could be through contaminated water and food or through close contact with someone infected or the feces of an infected person. Traveling to countries where there is no clean drinking water or proper sewage disposal increases the risk of salmonella infection. In most cases, salmonella infection is caused by consumption of undercooked or raw meat, poultry, eggs or egg products, or drinking milk that hasn't gone under pasturization. The incubation period, or the time between exposure and illness, can last anywhere from 6 hours to 6 days. People who have salmonella infection frequently believe they have the stomach flu.

Most people experience diarrhoea, fever, and stomach (abdominal) cramps within 8 to 72 hours of exposure. Most healthy people recover in a few days to a week without any special treatment. Some people with salmonella infection have no symptoms and they become carriers and sometimes are usually the source of an outbreak. People having diarrhoea as their symptomps can experience severe dehydration. If the infection spreads beyond the intestines, life-threatening complications may occur. The symptoms of typhoid can be used to predict whether or not you have the fever. Symptoms are likely to emerge gradually, sometimes one to three weeks after disease exposure. The symptomps of typhoid include but are not limited to:
Nausea
Headache
Sweating
Diarrhoea
Dry cough
Chest rash
Muscle aches
Fever and Chills
Blood in the stool
Stomach (abdominal) cramps
Weakness and severe fatigue
Loss of appetite and weight loss
Delirium and hallucinations(Late symptoms)

When to See a Doctor?
You should consult a doctor immediately you notice signs and symptoms of typhoid fever. You should consult a specialist who is familiar with these areas to diagnose and treat typhoid. A lot of complications and deaths caused by Salmonella have been associated with late diagnosis or misdiagnosis. You can check here for the [Mboalab accurate diagnoser](linkComingSoon)

    <summary>Typhoid: Causes, Symptoms, Treatments and Preventions</summary>

Typhoid Fever also known as Enteric Fever, is caused nby a bacteria known as Salmonella Typhi. Typhoid has become a global issue and a threat to humanity because it is a serious issue which needs attention. There are certain things done that leads to contact with Salmonella Typhi. We will discuss these causes, as well as symptoms which could have correlations with typhoid fever, and preventions. For Treatments [see here](linkComingSoon)

Causes of Typhoid

Typhoid is caused by the bacteria called Salmonella typhi however, different situations lead to the ingestion of Salmonella, some of which are:

- Poor hygienic conditions
- Taking unsafe drinkable water
- Eating Contaminated food.
- Direct contact with someone infected.

Where is typhoid most prevalent?
Typhoid is most prevalent in these parts of the world
Asia
Africa
Caribbean
Central America
South America

Symptoms of typhoid?
The symptomps of typhoid include but are not limited to:

Fever 
Chills
Nausea
Headache
Diarrhoea
Sweating
Dry cough
Skin rashes
Muscle aches
Enlarged liver
Blood in the stool
Stomach (abdominal) cramps
Weakness and severe fatigue
Loss of appetite and weight loss
Delirium and hallucinations(Late symptoms)


How can I prevent Typhoid

It is preferable to avoid infection than to try to find a remedy. Although achieving public health goals that can help prevent and combat typhoid fever in many developing nations may be challenging, however, some measures that can be taken by individuals includes:
— Taking safe drinkable water
- Having better sanitation
- Having sufficient medical care. -
- Getting vaccinated (It aids in the development of immunity against bacteria within the body, which aids in the prevention of infection. However, vaccination does not guarantee that you will not become infected. Furthermore, because the vaccine's efficacy degrades over time, repeated immunizations would be required).

    <summary>What should I eat and avoid when I have typhoid</summary>
    Typhoid fever also known as Enteric fever ia a rare fever in developed countries but is common in developing countries. It can become a threat as typhoid may even lead to serious health problems. Typhoid is caused by a bacteria called Salmonella typhi, which can be very harmful for a human body.
It is passed on or contracted through contaminated food or water – unclean sewage-infested water or food. It spreads between individuals by direct contact with the faeces of an infected individual. Therefore, it is imperative for the person to wash hands properly after using the toilet. Diet changes are not the ideal way to treat typhoid fever, but it can surely help in reducing typhoid symptoms.

Foods to Consider when you have typhoid

Carbohydrates: During typhoid fever, a lot of energy is lost annd a better option for recovery is foods that are high in carbohydrates. Foods like porridge and boiled rice are suggested.

High calorie diet: During the course of the infection, a typhoid patient will undoubtedly lose weight. It is best to eat high-calorie, easily digestible foods to manage or prevent this weight loss. Bananas, potatoes, cereals, and other foods are examples.

Fruits with high Water content: Sweating and diarrhoea are symptoms of typhoid fever, and both cause water loss in the body, which can lead to dehydration. Fruits with a high water content are highly recommended for balancing the body's water level. Grapes, watermelons, and apricots are some examples.

Soups and broth: Soups are nutritious, digestible, and simple to make at home. They are relieving options that can help you fight fatigue and increase your energy. Vegetable soup, carrot soup, mushroom soup, and clear light chicken soup are all recommended.

Cooked Vegetables: Eating cooked vegetables will supply your body with the nutrients it needs to grow stronger. Vegetables that have been cooked or boiled, such as potatoes, carrots, beets, raw papaya, and squash, are excellent choices.

Fluids: It is critical to maintain your fluid levels and avoid dehydration while recovering from typhoid because dehydration is a major effect of the infection Water, herbal tea, glucose water, fresh fruit juices, and coconut water can all help to cleanse and revitalise your system.

Diary products: Typhoid patients suffer from protein deficiency during their illness. To get enough protein, it is recommended to consume dairy products such as yogurt, milk, and so on. Yogurt is strongly advisable because it is one of the best probiotic foods. Probiotics are good bacteria that aid in the improvement of your health and the treatment of many infections.

General Takeaways

- Consume easily digestible foods.
- Eat high-calorie diets
- Drink dairy products like milk
- Consume plenty of fluids.
- Consume immune-boosting foods to help boost your immune system.

Foods to Avoid

High Fiber: Fiber-rich foods are difficult to digest and put strain on the digestive system. Because typhoid has already weakened your digestive system, putting additional strain on it will worsen your condition.
Avoid all high-fiber foods because they are difficult to digest and put strain on your digestive system. Patients with typhoid have an upset stomach, which is exacerbated by eating fiber-rich foods. Raw fruits, oats, barley, seeds, whole grains, nuts, and legumes should all be avoided.

Oily and fried foods: Avoid all fried and oily foods while suffering from typhoid. These foods are hard to digest and they also put strain on your stomach. Remove chips, pakoras, frames, and other processed foods from your diet.

Spicy Food: Spicy and fried foods are strictly forbidden on the typhoid diet. Spicy foods can cause digestive and intestinal irritation. Inflammation should be avoided to the greatest extent possible. Hot peppers, paprika, cayenne pepper, chilli, vinegar, and other spicy foods should be avoided.

Dry Fruits: Dry fruits are nutritious but rather high in fiber. Dry fruits such as walnuts, almonds, and pistachios should be avoided during typhoid to relieve stomach pressure.

As previously stated, the main goal of a typhoid diet is to relieve digestive distress by adding and removing specific food items from your diet.
If you have typhoid, we understand that you may have certain cravings and that it can be difficult to avoid certain foods. However, it is recommended that you follow the diet rules so that your condition does not worsen and you can eat whatever you want in no time.
It is advised that you return to your normal diet after recuperating so that your body can resume its normal food intake and digestion routine.

Once again, keep in mind that a typhoid diet will not help treat or prevent typhoid fever and will only relieve stomach upset.

    <summary>Why should I use the Mboalab online typhoid diagnoser</summary>


Diagnosis [found here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/widal-test) and [here](https://www.testing.com/tests/widal-test/)

The symptoms that are observed in a person can be used to predict typhoid. However, a test is always the best way to be sure because any incorrect diagnosis or misinterpretation of symptoms by medical professionals—including doctors and nurses—could result in serious complications like intestinal bleeding or even fatality. The Widal test is the most frequently used test for tyhoid diagnosis.


The Felix-Widal test, also known as the Widal test, was created many years ago and is still one of the most popular diagnostic tests in use today. It finds antibodies that clump together against the O and H antigens of S. Typhi. The widal test is still used in many developing nations where enteric fever is endemic and limited resources necessitate the use of quick, inexpensive testing alternatives, even though it is no longer frequently performed in developed nations. The Widal test has significant limitations in its sensitivity and specificity, despite the fact that the procedure is simple to use. This raises questions about the test's reliability. An early stage of the illness may cause a false-negative Widal test, and a prior infection or exposure may cause a false-positive Widal test.

The Widal test is still used in resource-constrained continents (like Africa, Asia, etc.) in spite of its drawbacks. Widal tests can be affected by a number of variables, so it is best not to place too much reliance on them, according to researchers. The use of cultures, particularly blood cultures, is rather advised until another straightforward, affordable, and trustworthy choice becomes available.

A culture test can be run on the bone marrow, stool, blood, or urine. A small sample of your blood is placed on a special medium during a blood culture, which promotes the growth of bacteria. The presence of typhoid bacteria is examined in the culture under a microscope.However, a blood culture can be labor and time-intensive in regions of the world without access to automated machinery. Due to the Widal test's expediency, simplicity, and affordability, developing nations like those in Africa are left with no choice but to use it.

The limitations in the sensitivity of a widal test, mis diagnosis, errors gotten from lab reslts due to probably a lab technician carelessness or instruments, the inability of a patient being able to communicate precisely and concisely what they feel and observe, the inability of the doctors and nurses being able to tell what they feel, labor, cost and time intesiveness of cultures have all lead the Mboalab community to develop adequate diagnostic testing for enteric fever.

What Mboalab Diagnoser  solves:

- It eliminates mis dignosis
- Eliminates the mis-interpretation gotten from how patients communicate what they feel to doctors and how doctors communicate what they observe too
- it Eliminates the mis-interpretation of doctors observations
- It saves time as a patient get diagnosed in a short time.
- It is not labour or cost intensive.
  

How does the Mboalab Diagnoser work?
The diagnoser is able to predict if you have typhoid because we have combined our human doctors intelligence with AI systems to give results. Our AI system has been trained based on data and symptoms of people infected with Salmonella to give accurate and rapid diagnosis 

How do I use the Mboalab diagnoser?
The diagnoser works in two phases.

1. It collects the symptoms of a patient to predict if you have typhoid and even go further to predict the severity of the typhoid.
2. It takes the smear image and compares it against other known cases it has seen. It also allows you to analyze the image.
