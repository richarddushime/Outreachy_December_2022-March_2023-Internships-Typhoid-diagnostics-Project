# I CHANGED THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE TO MAKE IT READABLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE

## HOW IT WORKS

In the components folder all the routing of the web app are placed under a generic folder called '\_routes' and all UI view are under a feature folder called 'pages'

#### OVERVIEW

           └───src                                     # Source code
              |___ asset                               # images
              |___ components
                      ├───pages                        # Contains all the project UI pages
                            └─── About
                            └─── Home
                            └─── Login
                            └─── Register
                            └─── AppLayout
                            └─── Comment
                            └─── NavBar
                            └─── Page404
                            └─── Contact
                            └─── Service
                            └─── Termsofuse

                      └───_routes                       # Contains all the project routing

# I WROTE CLEAN CODE AND COMMENTED WHERE NECESSARY

I made sure that the code is readable and understandable by commenting where necessary and also making sure that the code is clean and easy to understand, I also made sure that the code is not redundant and that it is not too long. I implemented the DRY (DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF) principle as much as I could in my code.

## Naming convention

I used camelCase for variables & callbacks, PascalCase for components & functions and kebab-case for css classes.

## Reusable components

I made sure that the components are reusable and that they are not too long and that they are not redundant.

# BETTER USER EXPERIENCE AND UI

I used Ant Design to make the UI look better and also to make the user experience better.
I made sure that the UI is responsive and that it is easy to use and navigate through. I also made sure that the UI is not too cluttered and that it is not too distracting.
