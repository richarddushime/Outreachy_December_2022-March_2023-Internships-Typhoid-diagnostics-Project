## **Task 0**

I have completed the following tasks:
<br/> &check; Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one)
<br/> &check; Go through documentation on basic knowledge on how to use, write and contribute on GitHub. Some helpful resources were:

<br/> -&check; How to use GitHub [Used this resource](https://devmountain.com/blog/what-is-github-and-how-do-you-use-it/)

<br/> -&check; Writing on GitHub [Resource here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

<br/> -&check; How to write MarkDown [Resource here](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=github+markdown)

<br/> -&check; How to understand/use GitHub [Resource Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZGeaHPoaw)

<br/> -&check; How to contribute to GitHub [Resource Here](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/)

<br/> &check; Use acquired knowledge to contribute to a selected task.

After researching on the above, I was able to use the following steps in contibuting to this task:-

-Forked the repo from https://github.com/Mboalab/Outreachy_December_2022-March_2023-Internships-Typhoid-diagnostics-Project.

-Cloned the repository, using "`git clone`https://github.com/tracy-y/Outreachy_December_2022-March_2023-Internships-Typhoid-diagnostics-Project/tree/Outreachy_December_2022-March_2023-internships/Tracey%20Yan" on my development environment and did a cd into the folder to open on VSCode.

- Created a branch/switched to the new branch using "`git checkout -b "Outreachy_December_2022-March_2023-internships"`"
- Created the necessary folders following this folder structure:
  - Outreachy_December_2022-March_2023-internships `mkdir Outreachy_December_2022-March_2023-internships`
    - December-March-Contributions `mkdir December-March-Contributions`
      - [Applicant Name] `mkdir Tracey_Yan`
        - Task0.md `touch Task0.md`
        - Task1.md `touch Task0.md`
- Made changes to the created file
- Did a `git add .` to add all files for staging.
- Did a `git commit -m "Submit Task 0"` to commit my changes.
- Did a `git push origin Outreachy_December_2022-March_2023-internships`
- Made a pull request to the upstream.

#### **Conclusion**

I have learned a lot about the fundamental knowledge of GitHub and well communicated with other applicants to learn from them.
I'm looking forward to contributing to other tasks.
