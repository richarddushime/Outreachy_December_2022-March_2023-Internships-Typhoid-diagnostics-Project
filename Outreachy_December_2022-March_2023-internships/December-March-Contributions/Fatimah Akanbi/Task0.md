## **Task 0**

Hello, I am [**Fatimah Akanbi**](https://github.com/akanbifatimah), a Post Graduate student at the University of Lagos, Lagos Nigeria. I am also a creative and result-oriented Front-end developer. I enjoy working on developing web and mobile applications.

I am very excited to contribute to this project as I understand how valuable this project would be to the human race when published as I have been sick with typhoid before and haven't forgotten my experience even if it happened quite some time ago, so I  understand the great importance of this project.

I'm looking forward to contributing to the success of this cause.

### **Tasks**

I have completed the following tasks:
<br/> &check; Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one)
<br/> &check; Go through documentation on basic knowledge on how to use, write and contribute on GitHub. Some helpful resources were:

- Did a  `git remote add origin` https://github.com/akanbifatimah/Outreachy_December_2022-March_2023-Internships-Typhoid-diagnostics-Project.git to set my fork as the 'origin' remote
